Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network Training Techniques | main | WIP(setup): Initial commit - Set up neural network training project

Initial repository setup establishing the foundation for the neural network training
techniques project. This commit creates the basic file structure including a README
with project overview and a .gitignore file with Python/Jupyter patterns.

Every project starts with initialization. This represents the moment a developer creates
a new repository and sets up the basic file structure before any actual development work.

Changes:
- Created README.md with project overview and basic structure
- Added .gitignore with Python/Jupyter patterns
- Established project foundation

Files: 2 (README.md, .gitignore)
