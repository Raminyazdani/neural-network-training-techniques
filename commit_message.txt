Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network Training Techniques | main | WIP(model): Create baseline network instance and verify architecture

Instantiated the baseline network model and printed the architecture for verification,
confirming that layer dimensions and parameter counts are correct before proceeding to
the training phase.

After defining the class, the developer creates an instance to verify the architecture
is correct before proceeding to training. This is a natural checkpoint in development
that catches any architectural issues early. Printing the model summary helps validate
the expected parameter count and layer structure.

Changes:
- Instantiated baseline network: model_baseline = NeuralNetwork()
- Printed model architecture for verification
- Confirmed layer dimensions and parameter counts

Files: 4 (notebook updated with network instantiation)
