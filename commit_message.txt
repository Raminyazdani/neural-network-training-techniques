Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network Training Techniques | main | WIP(dependencies): Add requirements.txt with PyTorch dependencies

Added comprehensive requirements.txt file defining all Python dependencies needed for
the project including PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Jupyter with appropriate version
constraints for reproducibility.

After initializing the repository, the next logical step is defining dependencies so the
development environment can be set up. This allows other developers to replicate the
environment and ensures consistent behavior across different machines.

Changes:
- Added requirements.txt with PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter
- Specified version constraints for reproducibility (>=2.0.0 for PyTorch, etc.)

Files: 3 (+requirements.txt)
