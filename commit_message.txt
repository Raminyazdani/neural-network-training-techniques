Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network Training Techniques | main | WIP(notebook): Create notebook with project title and introduction

Created the main Jupyter notebook file (batch_normalization_study.ipynb) with a
professional title and comprehensive introduction explaining the batch normalization
study and the comparison approach between baseline and BatchNorm networks.

With dependencies defined, the developer creates the main notebook file and writes the
introduction. Starting with documentation helps clarify the project goals before diving
into implementation. This establishes the narrative and purpose of the study.

Changes:
- Created batch_normalization_study.ipynb
- Added title cell: "Neural Network Training Techniques"
- Added introduction explaining the batch normalization study
- Described the comparison approach (baseline vs. BatchNorm)

Files: 4 (+batch_normalization_study.ipynb)
