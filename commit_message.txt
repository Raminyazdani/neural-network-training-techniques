Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network Training Techniques | main | WIP(evaluation): Implement test set evaluation and baseline training

Added evaluation function for computing test set accuracy with proper no_grad context,
then trained the baseline network for 5 epochs and recorded the baseline accuracy
results for later comparison.

After implementing training, evaluation is needed to measure performance. Training the
baseline first establishes a reference point before implementing the BatchNorm variant.
The evaluation function uses torch.no_grad() for efficiency and follows PyTorch best
practices for inference.

Changes:
- Added evaluation function for test accuracy
- Implemented test loop with no_grad context
- Trained baseline network for 5 epochs
- Recorded baseline accuracy results

Files: 4 (notebook updated with evaluation and baseline results)
