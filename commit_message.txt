Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network Training Techniques | main | feat(portfolio): Add project metadata and final portfolio refinements

Final polish completing the transformation from working project to portfolio piece.
Created project identity files, transformation documentation, and applied all portfolio-
readiness changes. All assignment traces removed. Portfolio-ready state achieved.

This final step includes metadata, identity files, and ensures everything is polished
for portfolio presentation. The project_identity.md defines professional naming, tech
stack, and problem statement. The report.md documents the entire transformation process.
Suggestion ledgers track all changes made for portfolio readiness.

Changes:
- Created project_identity.md with professional display title and tagline
- Added GitHub description and topics for discoverability
- Documented tech stack, dependencies, and problem/approach overview
- Added inputs and outputs summary
- Created report.md documenting the portfolio transformation phases
- Created suggestion.txt with portfolio-readiness findings and statuses
- Created suggestions_done.txt with all applied changes (before/after + locators)
- Final .gitignore adjustments
- All assignment traces removed from notebook and README
- Portfolio-ready state achieved

Files: 8 (all project files including documentation)

This commit marks the completion of the core development and portfolio transformation.
The project is now ready for professional presentation.
