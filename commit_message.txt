Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network Training Techniques | main | WIP(data): Implement FashionMNIST data loading with PyTorch

Implemented complete data loading pipeline for the FashionMNIST dataset using PyTorch's
DataLoader utilities. Added all necessary imports and configured data transformers with
proper normalization for training and test sets.

Before building models, data pipelines must be established. This is a fundamental step
in any ML project. The data loading must be completed before any model training can
occur. FashionMNIST is configured for automatic download, eliminating manual setup.

Changes:
- Added imports (torch, torchvision, torch.nn, torch.nn.functional, matplotlib, numpy)
- Implemented data transformers (ToTensor, Normalize)
- Set up training and test dataloaders with batch size 64
- Configured FashionMNIST dataset for automatic download

Files: 4 (notebook updated with imports and data loading)
