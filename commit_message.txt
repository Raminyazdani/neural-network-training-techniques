Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network Training Techniques | main | WIP(structure): Add section headers and notebook structure

Added organizational section headers to the notebook creating a clear skeleton for the
implementation flow. Sections include Setup and Data Loading, Baseline Network, Network
with Batch Normalization, and Performance Comparison.

Before writing code, establishing the structure helps organize thoughts and provides a
roadmap for implementation. This structural planning ensures a logical flow and makes
the notebook easier to follow. Each section will be filled in subsequent commits.

Changes:
- Added section headers for Setup and Data Loading
- Added section header for Baseline Network
- Added section header for Network with Batch Normalization
- Added section header for Performance Comparison
- Created skeleton for the notebook flow

Files: 4 (notebook updated with structure)
