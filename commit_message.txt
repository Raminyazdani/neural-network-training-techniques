Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network Training Techniques | main | WIP(analysis): Add performance visualization and comparative analysis

Implemented matplotlib visualizations comparing training accuracies and added
comprehensive analysis section discussing convergence speed differences, final accuracy
comparison, BatchNorm stability benefits, and training dynamics observations.

With both models trained, the developer creates visualizations to communicate results
effectively. The analysis section interprets the findings and draws conclusions about
the effectiveness of batch normalization. Line plots show training curves side-by-side,
making the differences immediately apparent to viewers.

Changes:
- Implemented matplotlib visualization comparing accuracies
- Created line plots showing training curves for both networks
- Added analysis section discussing convergence speed differences
- Discussed final accuracy comparison and BatchNorm stability benefits
- Added observations on training dynamics

Files: 4 (notebook completed with all analysis cells)
