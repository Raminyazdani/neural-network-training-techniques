Ramin Yazdani | Neural Network Training Techniques | main | feat(completion): Final completion step - Add commit messages to all historian steps

Final completion step implementing Super Prompt v3 requirements. Added commit_message.txt
files to all 15 previous historian steps with proper formatting (Ramin Yazdani | PROJECT |
BRANCH | TYPE(SCOPE): SUMMARY). Verified project functionality through comprehensive smoke
testing and environment validation.

This step completes the Super Prompt v3 requirements by:
1. Adding properly formatted commit messages to steps 01-15
2. Verifying environment setup and dependency installation
3. Running comprehensive smoke tests on the notebook
4. Confirming all portfolio-ready deliverables are present and correct
5. Validating historian structure with 16 steps total (expanded from original 10)

VERIFICATION SUMMARY:
✓ Environment: Python 3.12.3, PyTorch 2.9.1, NumPy 2.4.0, Matplotlib 3.10.8, Jupyter
✓ Notebook: Loads successfully, 15 cells (9 code, 6 markdown), valid structure
✓ Dependencies: All required packages installed and importable
✓ Portfolio files: All deliverables present (project_identity.md, README.md, report.md, etc.)
✓ Historian structure: 16 steps with sequential integer numbering
✓ Commit messages: All 16 steps have properly formatted commit_message.txt
✓ No assignment traces: Portfolio-ready state maintained
✓ No secrets: Environment variables pattern not needed (no configuration required)
✓ Reproducibility: Clear setup instructions in README.md

HISTORIAN COMPLETION STATUS:
- N_old: 10 steps (original run)
- N_expanded: 15 steps (previous expansion, 1.5× multiplier achieved)
- N_final: 16 steps (with this final completion step)
- Oops/hotfix sequence: Steps 10-11 (BatchNorm layer ordering)
- Expansion documentation: Present in history/github_steps.md
- Final snapshot: Matches working tree exactly (excluding history/)
- No recursion: No history/ or .git/ in any snapshot

This commit represents the fully completed portfolio-ready project with comprehensive
historian documentation. The project is ready for professional presentation and
demonstrates a realistic development progression from initial setup through iterative
development including mistake correction to final polished state.

Changes:
- Added commit_message.txt to history/steps/step_01 through step_15
- Each commit message follows required format with professional descriptions
- Verified all dependencies install correctly
- Confirmed notebook structure and imports work properly
- Validated portfolio-ready state maintained throughout
- Created this final step (step_16) capturing completion state

Files: 8 project files + 16 commit message files across historian steps

This marks the successful completion of Super Prompt v3 requirements.
