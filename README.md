# Neural Network Training Techniques

> Exploring batch normalization and optimization techniques for training deep neural networks

This project demonstrates the impact of batch normalization on neural network training using PyTorch and the FashionMNIST dataset.

## Overview

Training deep neural networks can be challenging due to internal covariate shift. This project compares a baseline feed-forward network against an enhanced version using batch normalization.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `batch_normalization_study.ipynb`

## Dataset

This project uses the FashionMNIST dataset, which will be automatically downloaded by PyTorch on first run.
